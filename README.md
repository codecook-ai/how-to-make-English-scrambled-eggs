## 🔪 Instructions

1. **Crack and whisk the eggs**  
   - In a bowl, crack the eggs and whisk gently with a fork or whisk.  
   - Add a pinch of salt and a small splash of milk or cream (optional).  

2. **Heat the pan**  
   - Place a non-stick pan over **low to medium-low heat**.  
   - Add the butter and let it melt slowly without burning.  

3. **Cook the eggs**  
   - Pour in the eggs and let them sit for a few seconds.  
   - Using a spatula, **stir gently and slowly**, scraping from the bottom and edges of the pan.  
   - Continue stirring until the eggs start to thicken but are still slightly runny.  

4. **Remove from heat early**  
   - Take the pan off the heat **just before the eggs are fully set** — they’ll keep cooking from residual heat.  

5. **Season and serve**  
   - Add black pepper and adjust salt to taste.  
   - Serve immediately on **buttered toast** or with **grilled tomatoes and bacon** for a classic English breakfast.

## 💡 Tips
- **Low heat** is the secret to creamy scrambled eggs.  
- Stir gently; don’t overmix, or the eggs will turn dry.  
- You can add **chives**, **cheese**, or **smoked salmon** for extra flavor.
